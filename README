This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=133

When active, TableTab.vim remaps the <Tab> key in insert mode, to
the function, which adjusts the tab stops according to the previous
line.  If this line matches /^\s*[_=*\-]\+ *$/  (it is only of ===,
--- etc.) the line before is checked.

Should be useful for editing tables.
